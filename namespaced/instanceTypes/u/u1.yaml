    series.description: |-
      The U Series is quite neutral and provides resources for
      general purpose applications.

      *U* is the abbreviation for "Universal", hinting at the fact that
      this family is providing general compute resources to
      workloads.

      VMs of instance types will share physical CPU cores on a
      time-slice basis with other VMs.
